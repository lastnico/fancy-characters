Welcome to Fancy Characters (*the* Chrome Extension) Repository!

Fancy Characters is a perfect extension for symbols and logos lovers, available on most computers and websites, 
but never used due to the difficulty to reach them with a standard keyboard. 

It provides list of most used and interesting Unicode characters, which could be inserted with a single click in 
all websites input and textareas. Available sections are: Symbols (smileys ☺ ☻ ☹ ☃ ☠, weather ☄ ☽ ☼ ☀ ☁, sym
bols ♽ ♻ ♫ ♩ ♪ ♿ ♀ ♂ ✈ ☎, greek glyphs ♉ ♊ ♋ ♌ ♍ ♎ ♏, chess ♕ ♖ ♗ ♘ ♙, Maths ± ¼ ½ ¾ ⅓ ⨛ ⨜ ♇ ♈ ♉ ≃ ≄, Shapes ● 
◐◑ ◒ ◓ ◔ ➞ ➟ ➠ ➡ ➤ ↸ ↹ ↺ ↻ ⇋... and many more! A fourth Custom section lets you personalize your own list of 
favorite symbols.

- Convert text (no images, just different letters) to funny formats: flipped text ʇxǝʇ pǝddılɟ
, rounded letters ⓡⓞⓤⓝⓓⓔⓓ ⓛⓔⓣⓣⓔⓡⓢ,...

- Use additional converters: Braille ⠨⠁ ⠎⠍⠁⠇⠇ ⠞⠑⠎⠞, Leet Speak L33t 5p34k and even Morse ... ___ ....

- And finally, for encryption lovers, a quick way to check MD5, SHA-1 and ROT-13 of text snippets.
